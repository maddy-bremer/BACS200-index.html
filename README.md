<h1>BACS 200- Maddy Bremer home page</h1>
<p>
  This is my home page which is also the start of project 2. I do enjoy this class and getting to learn how to make a website through codeing but, sometimes I do get confused with steps in the project and it takes me awhile to figure them out.

  I am a junior and I play volleyball here at UNCO and am a middle blocker. I came from Minnesota orginally, but my plan is after graduation I want to stay here in colorado.
